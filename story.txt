Once upon a time, there lived a monkey who resided on a jamoon tree,  which was on the banks of a river.
In the same forest, lived a crocodile and his wife.
One day , the Crocodile came to the banks of the river and rested under the tree.
The kind hearted monkey offered him some fruits.
The Crocodile came back the next day for some more fruits as he loved them.
As the days passed by , the monkey and Crocodile became good friends.
